INTRODUCTION
============

This code is an implementation of the Genetic Algorithm (GA) for the traveling 
salesman problem (TSP) presented in our paper: 

Yuichi Nagata and Sigenobu Kobayashi, Powerful Genetic Algorithm using Edge 
Assembly Crossover for the Traveling Salesman Problem, Informs Journal on 
Computing, Vol. 25, No. 2, pp. 346–363 (2013)

The code is written in C++ and is distributed for research use. The author 
reserves all rights to the code. The implemented algorithm is the default GA
presented in the paper. Use the code at your own risk, and we make no guarantees
about the correctness of this code. 



========
CONTENTS 
========

Two program codes: "Normal" version and "Large" version


Each version consists of the following files:

main.cpp
 - The main function

env.cpp, env.h
 - Main procedure of the GA

kopt.cpp kopt.h
 - Local search with the 2-opt neighborhood

cross.cpp cross.h 
 - Edge assembly crossover

evaluator.cpp evaluator.h
 - Pre-processing procedures to the TSP instance

indi.cpp, indi.h 
 - An individual (tour)

rand.cpp, rand.h
 - Procedures for generating a random number and permutation etc 

sort.cpp, sort.h
 - Procedures for sorting

***.tsp
 - Several TSP instances (TSPLIB format)



=======
COMPILE 
=======

Perform the following commands. Then, the executable file "jikken" will be 
created.

g++ -o jikken -O3 main.cpp env.cpp cross.cpp evaluator.cpp indi.cpp rand.cpp kopt.cpp sort.cpp -lm



=====
USAGE
=====

It is recommended to use the Normal version. If the Normal version cannot 
work due to the lack of memory in your computer (e.g. 5.3GB (N = 25000)), 
use the Large version (e.g. 730MB (N = 25000)). The Large version will be 
about 1.3-1.5 times slower (see Appendix B of the Online Supplement of the paper). 


Execute the following command to run the GA.
  ./jikken <integer1> <string1> <integer2> <integer3> <string2>

  Example: ./jikken 10 DATA 100 30 rat575.tsp

  Meaning of the arguments:
   - <integer1> = number of trials
   - <string1>  = filename to which results are written
   - <integer2> = number of population (300 is recommended if N > 10,000)
   - <integer3> = number of offspring solutions (30 is recommended)
   - <string2>  = instance filename (the instance must conform with TSPLIB format)


After the execution of the GA is finished, two files (DATA_Result and DATA_BestSol)
will be generated. 

  DATA_Result: A summary of the results is recorded in the following entry

  0 6773 173 0 3
  1 6773 174 0 3
  2 6773 166 0 3
  3 6773 173 0 3
  4 6773 173 0 3
  5 6773 171 0 3
  6 6773 182 0 3
  7 6773 168 0 3
  8 6773 173 0 3
  9 6773 173 0 3

  - 1st column: trial number
  - 2nd column: best tour length obtained in each run
  - 3rd column: the number of generations in each run
  - 4th column: the execution time (sec) for generating the initial population
  - 5th column: the execution time (sec) for each run of the GA


  DATA_BestSol: Best solutions are recorded for every run in the following entry

  575 6773
  1 24 25 26 27 28 29 52 50 51 74 73 72 49 48 47 70 71 93 94 116 ......
  ......
  ......

  - 1st line: number of cities, tour length
  - 2nd line: a solution representing a sequence of the cities
  - ....
  - ....


================
ADDITIONAL USAGE
================

By using a function gEnv->WritePop() in the main function (main.cpp), all tours 
in the population at the end of each run are recorded to a file (DATA_POP_*), 
where * is the trial number.  

When you wish to run the GA, starting with a given initial population, execute 
the following command to run the GA, where <string3> is the filename of the 
initial population. The file "DATA_POP_0" obtained above is an example of the 
input file.

  ./jikken <integer1> <string1> <integer2> <integer3> <string2> <string3>

  Example: ./jikken 10 DATA2 100 30 rat575.tsp DATA_POP_0


We can change the configuration of the GA by modifying the functions 
TEnvironment::Init() and TerminationCondition() in env.cpp. 

  Example1: Default setting
  fStage = 1;       /* Stage I */
  fFlagC[ 0 ] = 4;  /* Diversity preservation: 1:Greedy, 3:Distance, 4:Entropy */
  fFlagC[ 1 ] = 1;  /* Eset Type: 1:Single-AB, 2:Block2 */ 

  Example2: Only Stage II is performed using EAX with the Block2 strategy
  fStage = 2;       /* Stage I */
  fFlagC[ 0 ] = 4;  /* Diversity preservation: 1:Greedy, 3:Distance, 4:Entropy */
  fFlagC[ 1 ] = 2;  /* Eset Type: 1:Single-AB, 2:Block2 */ 

  Example3: The greedy selection is used instead of the entropy-preserving selection.
  fStage = 1;       /* Stage I */
  fFlagC[ 0 ] = 1;  /* Diversity preservation: 1:Greedy, 3:Distance, 4:Entropy */
  fFlagC[ 1 ] = 1;  /* Eset Type: 1:Single-AB, 2:Block2 */ 


When you wish to run the GA on a TSP instance with a specific definition of 
the edge length, please modify the function TEvaluator::SetInstance in evaluator.cpp


==========
PARAMETERS 
==========

You may wish to change some parameters of the default GA. I provide some tips on how 
to change several parameters.

 - The termination condition (see Section 2.2) can be changed by modifying the 
   function TerminationCondition() in env.cpp. 

 - In cross.cpp, nearMax = 10 by default. This parameter corresponds to N_{near} in 
   the paper (see Step 5.3 of the EAX algorithm in Section 3.1). If the distance
   matrix of an input TSP instance dose not follow the 2D Euclidean distance or 
   similar ones (e.g., a random distance matrix), you may be able to get better 
   results by increasing the value of this parameter.
